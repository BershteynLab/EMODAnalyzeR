# `calculate.prevalence`

Calculate prevalence in an EMOD simulation


## Description

Defaults to calculating HIV prevalence, but also may be used to calculate fraction of PLHIV who know their status, ART coverage, or other measures involving a numerator and denominator.
 Prevalence = (numerator)/(denominator)


## Usage

```r
calculate.prevalence(
  data,
  stratify_columns = c("Year", "Gender", "sim.id"),
  numerator = "Infected",
  denominator = "Population"
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`data`     |     A tibble returned from read.simulation.results()
`stratify_columns`     |     List of strings, names of stratifying columns included in the `group_by` function call before aggregation. The list should include sim.id (or sim.ix) as an argument to calculate the prevalence for each individual simulation run.
`numerator`     |     String, name of prevalence numerator
`denominator`     |     String, name of prevalence denominator
