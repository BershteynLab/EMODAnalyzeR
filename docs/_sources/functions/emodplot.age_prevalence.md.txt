# `emodplot.age_prevalence`

Plot age-prevalence curves, stratified by year and gender


## Description

Plots age-prevalence curves using EMOD simulation outputs. Plots will show mean prevalence +/- 2 standard deviations.


## Usage

```r
emodplot.age_prevalence(
  data,
  subset_years = c(2005),
  age_bins = c(15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 99),
  title = "Age-Prevalence Curves"
)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`data`     |     A tibble returned from read.simulation.results(..., stratify_columns = c("Year", "Age"," "Gender"), aggregate_columns = c("Population","Newly.Infected", "Infected")). More aggregate columns can be used, but more stratify columns will cause problems in the plot.
`subset_years`     |     list of years to plot
`age_bins`     |     list of age bin boundaries, will be used to generate a vector of age bins formatted as "[age_0,age_1)", "[age_1,age_2)", etc
`title`     |     Plot Title


## Value

ggplot of age-prevalence curves
