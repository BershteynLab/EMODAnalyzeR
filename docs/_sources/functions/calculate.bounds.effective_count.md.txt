# `calculate.bounds.effective_count`

Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval of an estimate given effective counts. This is used to
 calculate confidence intervals from EMOD calibration data that comes from a Beta distribution


## Description

Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval of an estimate given effective counts. This is used to
 calculate confidence intervals from EMOD calibration data that comes from a Beta distribution


## Usage

```r
calculate.bounds.effective_count(mean_vectors, effective_counts)
```


## Arguments

Argument      |Description
------------- |----------------
`effective_counts`     |     A vector of the effective number of samples from which the measurement was made
`mean_vector`     |     A vector of the estimated value of a measurement


## Value

A tibble with columns lb and ub corresponding to upper and lower bounds (95 % CI)
